# 🔐 Auth App

This is a simple app for practicing authentication with external APIs and also protected navigation on React Native apps.

I made this one for practing the use of Native features from devices, like the Camera,
Location and the device embedded SQLite.

I used Firebase Authentication because I was too lazy to make a Back-End myself 😝

## 🚀 How to get up and running

1. Create a Firebase Authentication on your Firebase project
2. `git clone` this repository
3. Create a `.env` file on the project root following the `.env.example` file
4. Run `npm install` on the project root
5. Run `npm run start:YOUR_OS`, changing `YOUR_OS` either to `android` or `ios`
